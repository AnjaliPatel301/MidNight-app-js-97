# 🌙 Midnight Background Changer

A creative project built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** where the background color changes exactly at **midnight (12:00 AM)** and displays a special message on the screen.


## 🚀 Features

- Detects system time in real-time
- Automatically changes background color at **12:00 AM**
- Displays **"Midnight"** message when time hits midnight
- Clean and responsive UI
- Built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries)

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📁 Folder Structure

midnight/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js


## 📝 How It Works

- JavaScript's `Date` object is used to track time continuously using `setInterval`.
- When the system time reaches `"00:00"`, background color is changed using DOM manipulation.
- A message like `"🌙 Midnight"` is shown in the center of the page.
- Page remains interactive and can be extended with animations.
